// Relationship "dynamics" turns the raw numbers the game stores (affinity, chemistry, fights, partner, crush, the event
// history) into named relationships that dialogue can actually use - "best friends", "bitter rivals", "exes", "still hurt
// by the cheating" - and the same for how each villager currently sees THE PLAYER ("skeptical", "has a crush on you",
// "unsure", "thinks you're best friends" etc). No raylib here, so tests.cpp can run it.
//
// Nothing new is stored for villager-to-villager dynamics: they are DERIVED from what social.h already saves, so they can
// never drift out of sync with it. How a villager sees the player uses three saved numbers per villager (opinion, trust,
// romance) plus how often you've talked to them and hit them.
